Type "cmake ."to creat Makefile  
Type "make" to compile  
The output file is in the bin folder  


if you want to rebuild and compile the code  
Type make clean  
Type "rm -rf build" to remove build file  

Note that you may get the following notice "The current CMakeCache.txt directory is different than the directory where CMakeCache.txt was created." Remove "CMakeCache.txt" and "cmake_install.cmake" may help. :)
